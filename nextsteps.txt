without Game class the structure was:
-Round()
  -Player(round)
    -Strategy(player,round)

now:
-Game()
  -Player()
  -Round(game)1
  -Player.prepare_for_round(round1)
    -Strategy(player,round1)
  -Round(game)2
  -Player.prepare_for_round(round1)
    -Strategy(player,round1)
  -Round(game)3
  -Player.prepare_for_round(round1)
    -Strategy(player,round1)
