  -implement strategies from sas?
  -refactor Strategy?


-implementation for up to 8 players
  -note that probabilities are for heads-up. 
   To create simul prob mode for x players? 
   Alternatively we could assume independence 
   (not exactly true) and calc prob^(num of opps)
   i.e. if prob=0.9 then prob of winning with both=0.81

-interactive mode
  -player attrib - human vs comp?
-use prob of draw in strats as well?
-Frontend implementation? 
  -ask Kacper?
-Strategy() improvements
  -Creating multiple strategies
