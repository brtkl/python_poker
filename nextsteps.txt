ISSUES

see tmp folder


exceptions:
def results(status, data):
    valid = {0, 1, 99}
    if status not in valid:
        raise ValueError("results: status must be one of %r." % valid)

Always try to raise the most appropriate exception you can - ValueError tells the caller of the function what's going on better than Exception does, for example.

/*interactive approach for tests:*/
# import os,sys,inspect
# currentdir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(inspect.getfile(inspect.currentframe())))
# parentdir = os.path.dirname(currentdir)
# sys.path.insert(0,parentdir) 

/*command line approach - running all tests*/
$ cd new_project
$ python -m unittest tests.test_antigravity           - to run single test program
$ python -m unittest				      - to run all test programs


Storing objects:
a) pickle with shelves
b) dill with shelves?
c) json
d) sqlite??



with open('company_data.pkl', 'wb') as output:
    company1 = Company('banana', 40)
    pickle.dump(company1, output, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

with open('company_data.pkl', 'rb') as input:
    company1 = pickle.load(input)
    print(company1.name)  # -> banana
    print(company1.value)  # -> 40
